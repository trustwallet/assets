    "description": "Jail Doge is a deflationary DeFi token that takes a 9% tax from each buy and sell. This tax acts to benefit the project as a whole by putting 3% in the liquidity pool for a stable price floor, 3% proportionally reflected back to all holders of a JAILDOGE token and 3% added to a marketing wallet to make sure that the project is able to succeed in the long term.",
