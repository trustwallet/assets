    "description": "Galaxy Goggle DAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the GG token. Each GG token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. MIM, AVAX) in the collateral pool, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. GGDAO also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting.",
