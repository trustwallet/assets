    "description": "A year and a half ago, a friend from Dubai sent me a Belgian Malinois named Broccoli. I chose the name for its green vibe and crypto association. Broccoli quickly bonded with me, though he wasn’t well-socialized and was scared of everything. He wasn’t toilet trained, so there were accidents. With lots of energy, I started biking with him, and he ran 15km without stopping. After almost a year apart, he still remembers me and is now a confident, strong dog.",
