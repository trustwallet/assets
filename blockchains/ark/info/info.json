    "description": "ARK (ARK) is a project that offers a suite of tools to create an ecosystem of interoperable blockchains. Using the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm, ARK's network is secured by delegates, who are appointed by ARK token holders through voting. ARK is also able to connect to external blockchains through the use of 'SmartBridges'.",
