And unlike most other gold investments, XAUt0 gives you full digital mobility and physical redeemability. You can hold it, trade it, lend it, or move it across chains while your asset remains physically backed and digitally composable. Beyond tokenized gold, XAUt0 is programmable, liquid gold built for the digital economy.",
