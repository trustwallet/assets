    "description": "“Buttcoin - The Next Bitcoin” is the meme version of Bitcoin. Launched on January 30, 2025, on Pump.fun, it’s a community-owned memecoin on Solana. The idea was inspired by a 4:20 minutes long YouTube video from 2013 called ;The Next Bitcoin?' by James D. McMurray, which poked fun at the confusing technicalities of Bitcoin to the average person and claimed that Buttcoin was an easier to understand version of Bitcoin.",
