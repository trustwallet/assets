    "description":"What in tarnation is a manner of expressin’ scorn. We holler it when we’re downright bamboozled by how things are runnin’, and by golly, we’re hollerin’ it now. Fake hound coins are appearin’ quicker than a jackrabbit and vanishin’ just as fast, all in the chase for a fast profit. WIT’s a whole ‘nother breed. We're plantin’ our boots firmly on the ground, here for the long haul.",
