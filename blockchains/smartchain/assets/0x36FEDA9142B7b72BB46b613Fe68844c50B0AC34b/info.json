To give audience an idea that this project would be mainly for women but men can also participate if their wives/daughters are not familiar with Crypto and how can these women get benefits out of it. For a reference, we are only tagging our X (previously Twitter) so that people can get an idea of what's coming next. Stay tuned folks!",
