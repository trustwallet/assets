    "description": "The biggest difference between Super Minesweeper and Microsoft Minesweeper is that each map is created by the player, not randomly generated by the system. Players create a unique game map, upload the map parameters to the Blockchain to obtain NFT credentials, and obtain the game map by referring to the NFT parameters on the chain at the beginning of Minesweeper.",
