    "description": "All the projects today rely on a donation-based system in order to further develop the product, as most of them present their project as an investment. This means that most of them rely on developers/marketing/any other name wallets to accomplish their roadmap. The main issue with this is that in order to get any value from those wallets they have to sell those tokens onto their community and therefore affecting token’s price. Some of them are intentionally hiding Rug Pulls behind those kinds of operations. $FLOKI$ is here to solve this issue. Each $FLOKI$ transaction will include a fee of 4% that will be converted into BNB and sent to the development wallet. By performing this operation $FLOKI$ will be able to perform marketing and develop products without any penalty to its holders. This way, Floki’s token, $FLOKI$, will only grow in value, a real value. Beside this, $FLOKI$ has two other advantages compared to other tokens. With each transaction $FLOKI$ will impose an additional 5% fee which will be redistributed between the holders based on their share of tokens. Thus, you will gain tokens only by holding them, no staking will be needed, the contract will take care of that. Considering a dead wallet has been created, it will act as a holder and the token will become deflationary. Note, that no one has access to the dead wallet.",
