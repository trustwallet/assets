    "description": "Rooted in ancient Chinese heritage, $CHOW draws inspiration from one of China’s oldest and most iconic dog breeds, the Chow Chow. Believed to date back over 8,000 years, the Chow Chow once served as a hunter, guardian, and royal companion to Chinese emperors. Recognized by its lion-like mane and blue-black tongue, it symbolizes strength, loyalty, and legacy.",
