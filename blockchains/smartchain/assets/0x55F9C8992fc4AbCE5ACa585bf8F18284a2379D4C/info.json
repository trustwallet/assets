    "description": "8lends is a decentralized P2P platform where Web3 investors fund real-world businesses. By leveraging blockchain, we provide direct access to real asset investments, ensuring transparency, capital protection, and a path to sustainable income.\n\n8lends is built on the Base blockchain, using a hybrid of Web2 and Web3 architecture. This structure provides the best of both spaces. Financial guarantees and investment collateral are protected by Maclear AG, while all transactions and investor payments are recorded on-chain for full transparency.\n\nThe $8LNDS token is a core utility and marketing asset for the 8lends ecosystem, backed by liquidity and integrated into our smart Reward System. This system uses a balance of buybacks, burning, and minting to maintain stable token circulation and prevent inflation.\n\nThe $8LNDS token is designed to grow our community and serve as a primary tool for accessing the platform and its investment opportunities. The company will provide full liquidity at launch, making the token tradable from day one.\n\n8lends' mission is to make P2P investing in real-world businesses simple, transparent, and accessible for every Web3 investor.",
