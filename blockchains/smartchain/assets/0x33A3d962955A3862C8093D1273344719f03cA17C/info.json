The ecosystem, which includes an NFT platform, is fueled by SPORE, a deflationary, globally-accepted currency available on Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain. The token seamlessly connects two massive blockchains and their user bases with the first of its kind Avalanche-BSC bridge, developed in-house by Spore.",
