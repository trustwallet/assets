    "description": "Atrum is built on a simple but powerful idea: users should earn value from their everyday digital actions. Millions of people download, share, and interact with social media content daily, yet traditional platforms offer no direct reward for this activity. Atrum changes this by combining a universal social media downloader with a blockchain-based reward system powered by Atrum Token.",
