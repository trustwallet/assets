    "description": "WOIL is a BNB Smart Chain token that wraps Oil Smart Chain’s native OIL 1:1 for cross-chain use. It maintains parity with OIL’s reserve-backed model, pegged to the real-time price of a Brent crude barrel. Holders can trade, provide liquidity, and interact with DeFi apps on BNB Chain. By enabling interoperability, wOIL expands access for investors, traders, and dApps—bringing oil-backed value directly into DeFi.",
