  "description": "OUTPAWFORM ($PAW) is a deflationary BEP20 token supporting animal welfare with full transparency. Every 6 months, a fixed amount of tokens is sold and 100% of the proceeds are donated to animal shelters. Simultaneously, the exact same amount of tokens is burned to ensure no inflation. Additionally, the founder is an active real-world treasure hunter: whenever a treasure is found, 10% of its value is used to buy back and burn PAW tokens. All donations and burns are published on social media to maintain full community trust.",
