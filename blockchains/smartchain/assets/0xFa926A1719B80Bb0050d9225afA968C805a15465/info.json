    "description": "Dejicoin (DEJI) is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) — designed to restore power to the community. With ownership renounced, liquidity locked, and LP tokens burned, Dejicoin operates with no admins, no central control, and no single point of failure. Every decision and upgrade is driven entirely by community governance, ensuring true transparency and trustlessness. Dejicoin isn’t just another token — it’s a movement for digital freedom, built to prove that blockchain can run entirely by code, not control.",
