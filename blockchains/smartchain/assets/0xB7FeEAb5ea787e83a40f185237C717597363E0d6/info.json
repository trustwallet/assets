   "description":"Introducing Xenon Play (XPLAY)  Xenon Play functions as the official Xenon Reward that can be generated from the Xenon Machine after activating the reward mechanism by inserting Xenon Liquidity Tokens or Xenon Pay Tokens. You can also use Xenon Play in the upcoming Xenon Pay Gaming Series such as Xenon Kart: Crypto Edition or Xenon Play: Minigames. Both games will have a Play To Earn game mode. It’s up to each individual whether they keep their Xenon Play (rewards) to use them in the upcoming games or if they treat it like a trading crypto asset. The fact that it can be treated like a trading crypto asset also gives each individual the chance to sell their Xenon Play (rewards) whenever they want, or give other people the chance to buy Xenon Play if they would like to do so. The total currency supply of Xenon Play exists out of 500,000,000 XPLAY. Xenon Play charges a 5% Tax Fee from each transaction. This 5% Tax Fee will be used to fund the Reward Mechanism in the Xenon Machine and Xenon Gaming Developments.",
