The official sETH token is currently undergoing migration with reduced trading activity, allowing this token to be used for research purposes analyzing user behavior and network interactions. This token is officially launched, with all necessary operations completed, including providing liquidity, pairing with Ethereum, and ensuring a strong holder base. The token has more than 12,000 holders and over 15,500 transactions. This asset is not intended for public investment or speculation. Differences between this token and the official sETH are clearly explained on our website and social media.",
