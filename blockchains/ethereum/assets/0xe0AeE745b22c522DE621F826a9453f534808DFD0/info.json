    "description": "MCU is the flagship token of the Meme Coin Universe, designated to solve the current issue of locating fair pre-sales in the ERC20 space. The utility of the token is two-fold: 1. All holders receive 6% ETH reflections on all transactions and 2. As a reward to HODL, holding 0.025% of the total supply earns the holder exclusive access to the subsequent pre-sales in the Meme Coin Universe ecosystem; a series of 10 fun & engaging projects that all provide a different solution in the ERC20 space.\n\nMCU has identified 10 widespread issues affecting the space and each project in the series addresses one with a proper solution. The most glaring issue is what this project decided to tackle first - finding reliable and fair pre-sale opportunities. That is why holding .025% supply of the MCU token will qualify the holder for eligibility for subsequent pre-sales launched within the MCU ecosystem.",
