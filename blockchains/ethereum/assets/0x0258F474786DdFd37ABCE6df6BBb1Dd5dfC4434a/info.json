    "description": "Built on the most advanced liquidity aggregator ever developed, Orion Protocol solves some of the largest issues in DeFi by aggregating the liquidity of the entire crypto market into one decentralized platform. This underpins each solution built on the protocol, including revolutionary trading solution Orion Terminal - aggregating the liquidity of the entire crypto market on one decentralized platform - as well as a suite of enterprise solutions for blockchains, exchanges, and crypto projects. Their roadmap also includes a price oracle and a high-margin DEX. Orion has ensured deep utility of its native ORN token across the entire protocol, integrating it into all main transactions to take the form of an internal currency or utility token.",
