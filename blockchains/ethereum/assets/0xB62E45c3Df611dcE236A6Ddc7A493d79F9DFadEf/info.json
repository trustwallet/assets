    "description": "Wall Street Memes is born out of the infamous GameStop fiasco of 2021, and the legacy of those brave Wall Street Bets heroes still endures today. It is the ultimate expression of the internet’s triumph over rampant capitalism. The token raised over $25m USD in the presale and recorded over $55m trading volume in the first 24hrs with listings on multiple tier 1 exchanges. Whilst the project initially started as a meme coin with meme only utility, there are big things coming, with announcements due on project updates very soon. ",
