Charizard Inu aim to be the biggest anime token. Charizard Inu is combined of the power of a community driven project, the meme potential and its ultilities including:
- ChariSwap: like Uniswap, but specialize in Anime Tokens, users can easily track the price, market cap, LP Lock, renounce status and trade our vetted anime tokens. Users can also trade up to 90% slippage, and more cool functions will be built on this over time.
- Generative NFTs: We are onboarding artists (who worked with Luffy, Deku and other big anime projects) to make our own NFT collections. Usecases for these NFT will include but are not limited to: trading on OpenSea, staking, and acting as assets for our game later.
- Play to earn: We are exploring and are in talk with some experienced game developers from Vietnam. To be able to make Charizard ""Play-To-Earn "" , we might have to adjust our tax structure in the near future. There will be one new tax called the ""Rewards Pool"" to distribute tokens for our players. Of course we will reduce the other tax so the total tax will never exceed more than 10%.
