    "description": "XAUt0 is the omnichain version of Tether Gold, with each token representing one troy ounce of real, physical gold stored in a Swiss vault and verified under ISAE 3000 standards. And unlike most other gold investments, XAUt0 gives you full digital mobility and physical redeemability. You can hold it, trade it, lend it, or move it across chains while your asset remains physically backed and digitally composable. Beyond tokenized gold, XAUt0 is programmable, liquid gold built for the digital economy.",
